# Overview
A version of the Trident skirt for the V0 and V0.1, supporting the C14 inlet and V0 display by Timmit.

The goal was to implement the aesthetic of the Trident skirt in the smaller form factor, using hardware and screws already in the V0.1 BoM where possible.

Currently, the C14 inlet section is designed for the inlet I bought, which differs from the one in CAD. I will be adding a BoM-compatible version.

The display enclosure is bad right now - looks OK once installed, but needs redesigning from scratch to assemble better (currently only possible by bending one of the middle parts).

A section will be designed to replace the display section for those without the display.

# BoM
This BoM doesn't include the rubber feet, though for clarity it does include some hardware which is reused from the V0 and V0.1 builds.
It assumes skirt to front and sides, with only the C14 at the rear. You'll need some VHB to hold the fans or fan blanks to the skirts.

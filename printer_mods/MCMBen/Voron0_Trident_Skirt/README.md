A version of the Trident skirt for the V0 and V0.1, supporting the C14 inlet and V0 display by Timmit.
Currently, the C14 inlet section is designed for the inlet I bought, which differs from the one in CAD. I will be adding a BoM-compatible version.
The display enclosure is bad right now - looks OK once installed, but needs redesigning from scratch to assemble better (currently only possible by bending one of the middle parts).

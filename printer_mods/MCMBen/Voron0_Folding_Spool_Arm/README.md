A folding spool holder arm for Voron 0 / Voron 0.1, inspired by [cipher94's mod on Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4572395) and the stock design.
There are two versions: one using the two pre-inserted nuts in the stock build, and one using an additional nut which can be inserted into the side extrusion if the bottom panelclip is removed first.
